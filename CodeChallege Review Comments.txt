1 Flight Ticket Booking 

Driver Object initiated wrongly due to which chromedriver was detecting properly
ElementLocator of Destination field is wrong updated id of it.

2. HotelBooking

Page object model used, but constructor and page factory jar file was not imported 
ALso not create initElements method, which create all WebElements

3.SigninTest
Frame was not handled after clciking on Signin Button which encounters the error.


Design wise:
Page Object model  can be implemented properly, which reduces the maintenance easily
CommonMethods is  missing which makes code lengthy, creation of xommon method will reduce to code length and will be easy for reusability.

Ex
setDriverpath, wait method and is element present 
Instead of wait command, webDriver wait can be used, which executed fast, as it move to next step once the specific condition.

Objects can be maintained in a separate class file for each page(for easy maintenance)
